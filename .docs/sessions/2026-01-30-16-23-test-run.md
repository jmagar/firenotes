## Goal
Run formatter, lint, type-check, and all tests (including E2E) to green.

## Work Summary
- Updated E2E test runner helper to capture CLI stdout/stderr via temp files using `spawnSync`, avoiding missing output in piped stdio.
- Re-ran formatter, linters, type checker, and full test suite.

## Reasoning Notes
- Piped child process stdout/stderr was empty in this environment; redirecting to temp files ensures deterministic capture for assertions.

## Commands Run
- `pnpm format`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm type-check`
- `pnpm test:all`

## Result
All linters, type checker, unit tests, and E2E tests passed. (Some E2E cases skipped due to missing external services/credentials.)
