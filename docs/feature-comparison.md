## Features We Added (15 Total)

### 1. Vector Database Integration
**Commands**: `embed`, `query`, `retrieve`

Complete semantic search stack:
- **TEI (Text Embeddings Inference)**: Local embedding service (port 53010)
- **Qdrant**: Vector database (port 53333)
- Automatic chunking with markdown-aware splitting
- Concurrent batch processing with p-limit

```bash
# Embed scraped content
axon scrape https://example.com --embed

# Semantic search
axon query "How do I authenticate?"

# Reconstruct full document
axon retrieve https://example.com
```

### 2. Vector Database Management (6 Commands)
**Commands**: `sources`, `stats`, `domains`, `delete`, `history`, `info`

Full lifecycle management of embedded content:

```bash
# List all indexed URLs
axon sources

# Show database stats
axon stats

# List unique domains
axon domains

# Delete by URL or domain
axon delete --url https://example.com
axon delete --domain example.com

# Time-based view of content
axon history

# Detailed URL info
axon info https://example.com
```

### 3. Enhanced Job Management (2 Commands)
**Commands**: `list`, `status`

Better visibility into long-running operations:

```bash
# List all active crawl jobs
axon list

# Enhanced system status (jobs + embedding queue)
axon status
```

### 4. Data Extraction Commands (2 Commands)
**Commands**: `extract`, `batch`

Batch processing and structured extraction:

```bash
# Extract structured data
axon extract https://example.com/product

# Batch scrape multiple URLs
axon batch https://site1.com https://site2.com --embed
```

### 5. Configuration Enhancement (1 Command)
**Command**: `view-config`

Separate read-only config viewer (official CLI uses `config` for both):

```bash
# View config without modifying
axon view-config
```

### 6. Self-Hosted Infrastructure

Our implementation uses a **completely self-hosted stack**:

| Service | Image | Port | Purpose |
|---------|-------|------|---------|
| Firecrawl | `ghcr.io/firecrawl/firecrawl` | 53002 | Main API |
| Patchright | `loorisr/patchright-scrape-api` | 53006 | Browser scraping |
| TEI | `ghcr.io/huggingface/tei` | 53010 | Text embeddings |
| Qdrant | `qdrant/qdrant` | 53333 | Vector database |

**Custom Patches**:
- Fixed `page.timeout()` → `page.wait_for_timeout()` bug in Patchright
- Mounted patched `patchright-app.py` via docker-compose volume

### 7. Automatic Embedding Integration

All scraping commands support automatic embedding:

```bash
# Scrape and embed in one command
axon scrape https://example.com --embed

# Crawl and wait for embedding completion
axon crawl https://example.com --embed --wait
```

## Features We're Missing (1 Total)

### `credit-usage` Command

The official CLI has a dedicated `credit-usage` command:

```bash
# Official CLI
axon credit-usage --json --pretty
```

**Our workaround**: Use the global `--status` flag which shows credits:

```bash
# Our CLI
axon --status
# Output includes: "Credits: 500,000 remaining"
```

## Architecture Differences

### Official CLI
```text
CLI → Firecrawl Cloud API (api.firecrawl.dev)
```

### Our CLI
```text
CLI → Local Firecrawl (53002) → Patchright (53006) → Chrome
                              ↓
                            TEI (53010) → Qdrant (53333)
```

## Use Case Comparison

| Use Case | Official CLI | Our CLI |
|----------|--------------|---------|
